## Description
> Note: This README file was generated using this application.

This is a simple NodeJS-based command line application that helps you to generate a professional `README.md` file.

It will contain 4 standard GitHub badges from [Sheild.io][badges] for: **Issues**, **Forks**, **Stars**, and the project **License**.

It will generate a README with a TOC (Table of Contents) that has links to the following sections:
  
  1. Description
  2. Installation
  3. Usage
  4. Contributing
  5. Tests
  6. Questions
  7. License
  
The License section is _dynamic_. When you select one of the available licenses it will give you a link to the full license being used that you can read more about on [ChooseALicense.com][cal]. If you select **null** for the license type, then the License section will not be included in your generated `README.md` file.
